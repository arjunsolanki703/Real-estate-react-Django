# Real Estate App using React as Frontend and Django
## Steps to Run the Application

Pull the repository into your device and run it as you used to run Django Application.

-   (You need to install 'requirements.txt' if you don't have these already)

-   (You also need to build React Application as it has been ignored in git and also need node_modules.)

-   Note: You need to provide your Google Account Details in Settings File.
